Hi, I'm [Alisha Bhimani](https://alishabhimani.ca/), a healthcare researcher and data scientist with a passion of exploration and learning. I believe that ***data-driven creative solutions*** can be used to make educated and informed decisions that have high societal impact. Along with providing data-drive solutions within healthcare and otherwise, I am currently exploring facets of data-drive art that use datasets to convery experiences and emotions to the audience.

- MS Health Data Science from Dartmouths
- Research Associate at Princess Margaret Cancer Center
- Currently learning how to be a **Data Artist**
- Avid caffinated coder (I will code in exchange of coffee!)
